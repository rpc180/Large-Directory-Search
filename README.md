# Large Directory Search
PS script that locates directories over a user selected size.  Subtracts sub-directory sizes from parent using a de-duplication method.  This script was developed as we were unable to install 3rd party software for recurisve directory analysis within our environment.

This script is the basis for the article located at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-space-always-gone-romel-punsal/
